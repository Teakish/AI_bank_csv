This project uses pycaret to classify the Bank Marketing dataset using the functions provided 
(given: Has the client subscribed to a term deposit?). 
Models are compared to choose the best one, given the Bank Marketing dataset the best model was catboost. 
It had the following metrics: 
Accuracy 0.9095,		
AUC 0.9095,		
Recall 0.9372,		
Prec. 0.9095,		
F1 0.9014,		
Kappa	0.9039,	 
MCC 0.5100,		
TT (Sec) 0.5163. 
Catboost was then used to plot several models.
